        <h1>Visiting San Diego <br>By Amber</h1>
        
        <p id="description-of-san-diego"> San Diego is a <strong>beautiful</strong> and diverse city in <em> California </em>. It is known for its pristine beaches, warm climate, and incredible attractions. 
            The city is also close to Los Angeles as they are about a 2 and a half hour drive apart. If you would like to visit Hollywood, the Walk of Fame, and the raving nightlife in Los Angeles, why not stop
            by San Diego for a more slow-paced, relaxed vacation?>

        These are the top reasons why you should visit San Diego:
        
        <ul>
            <li class="reasons"> The beaches there have breathtaking cliffs, secluded coves, stunning shores, and vibrant restaurants/nightlife. 
            <li class="reasons"> 
            <li class="reasons"> There are attractions in the city that are perfect for families, solo travellers, and adults! The world famous San Diego Zoo, for example, home to over 12 000 animals, is renowned for
                its naturalistic and lush habitats. For history lovers, there is also the San Diego Natural History Museum, which you cannot miss visiting!
