            The city is also close to <em>Los Angeles</em> as they are about a 2 and a half hour drive apart. If you would like to visit Hollywood, the Walk of Fame, and the raving nightlife in Los Angeles, why not stop
            by San Diego after for a more <em>slow-paced</em>, relaxed vacation?

        These are the top reasons why you should visit San Diego:
        
        <ul>
            <li class="reasons"> The beaches there have breathtaking cliffs, secluded coves, stunning shores, and vibrant restaurants/nightlife. The clear water, sandy shores, and sunny climate make the beaches there
                the ideal way to spend an afternoon.
